# Python Security Log Analyzer

A SOC-focused detection engineering project that parses Windows EVTX telemetry and identifies suspicious PowerShell execution and authentication abuse.

## Project Summary

This project was developed to demonstrate a practical detection workflow using real Windows event telemetry collected from a controlled virtual lab environment. The tool ingests exported EVTX files, parses raw XML records, normalizes event fields, and applies rule-based detection logic to identify potentially malicious PowerShell activity.

The current implementation includes:

- Windows Sysmon EVTX ingestion
- Windows Security EVTX ingestion
- XML namespace-aware event parsing
- EventData field extraction and normalization
- Suspicious PowerShell detection (Sysmon Event ID 1)
- Brute-force authentication detection (Security Event ID 4625)
- Threshold-based multi-event correlation
- False-positive reduction through rule tuning

## Detection Objective

The primary objective of the current detection logic is to identify suspicious PowerShell execution patterns commonly associated with adversary tradecraft, including:

- encoded PowerShell execution (`-enc`)
- in-memory execution via `IEX`
- remote content retrieval using `DownloadString`

## Detection Coverage

### PowerShell Abuse (MITRE T1059.001)
- Encoded commands (`-enc`)
- In-memory execution (`IEX`)
- Remote payload retrieval (`DownloadString`)

### Brute-Force Authentication (MITRE T1110)
- Event ID 4625 (failed logons)
- Grouping by TargetUserName and source IP
- Threshold-based detection (≥5 failures)
- Detection of both:
  - Local interactive logons (Type 2)
  - Network logons (Type 3)

## Lab Context

Telemetry used in this project was generated in a controlled lab consisting of:

- **Windows 11**: development environment and Git repository location
- **Windows 10 FLARE VM**: telemetry source and attack simulation target
- **Kali Linux VM**: attacker simulation platform for future detection scenarios

## Detection Status

### Implemented
- Sysmon process creation parsing
- Sysmon network connection parsing
- Suspicious PowerShell detection with tuning
- Security log parsing (Event ID 4625)
- Brute-force authentication detection
- Multi-event grouping and threshold-based detection

### Planned Improvements
- Time-based correlation of events
- Correlation of failed (4625) and successful (4624) logons
- Additional detection rules (persistence, lateral movement)
- Detection scoring and prioritization

## Core Workflow
- Export EVTX logs from the Windows 10 FLARE VM
- Transfer logs to the Windows 11 development environment
- Parse raw EVTX XML records with Python
- Normalize telemetry fields into structured dictionaries
- Apply rule-based detection logic
- Review detection output and tune logic to reduce false positives

## Key Findings So Far

The initial PowerShell detection logic produced a high false-positive rate due to Splunk service activity. Detection logic was subsequently refined to exclude service-generated events and require higher-signal indicators such as:

- `-enc`
- `iex`
- `downloadstring`

After tuning, the detector successfully identified true-positive suspicious PowerShell events generated in the FLARE VM.

## Status

The detection pipeline is fully operational and demonstrates:

- EVTX ingestion and parsing
- Structured event normalization
- PowerShell abuse detection (Sysmon)
- Brute-force authentication detection (Security logs)
- Multi-event correlation using threshold-based logic
- Evidence-backed analysis and documentation

The project reflects a practical SOC detection engineering workflow using real telemetry and controlled attack simulation.
